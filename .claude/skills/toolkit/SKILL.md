# Toolkit — Intelligence Hub & Feature Tiers

Two modes: generate a researched PM Intelligence Hub, or scaffold production infrastructure.

## Mode: `/toolkit research`

Generate a 7-tab HTML Intelligence Hub with actively researched, cited business intelligence.

**Full flow documented in:** `docs/plans/toolkit-research-flow.md`
**HTML spec documented in:** `docs/plans/html-prototype-spec.md`

### Execution Steps

1. **Read project context** — PRD, arch.md, CLAUDE.md. Extract domain, users, value prop, stack, costs.
2. **Classify product** — Revenue model, market type, stage, competitive density. Present to user for confirmation.
3. **Gather cost data** — Infer from arch.md stack or ask user for infrastructure costs.
4. **Web research** — 5-8 targeted searches: market size, competitors, pricing benchmarks, industry trends, customer acquisition channels. Cite every source.
5. **Deep dive** — WebFetch 3-5 high-value pages (competitor pricing, industry reports).
6. **Synthesize** — Organize findings into 7 tab structures with confidence tags.
7. **User review gate** — Present research summary. User confirms or corrects before HTML generation.
8. **Generate HTML** — Self-contained `docs/toolkit/index.html` with all 7 tabs, Chart.js, print CSS, dark mode.
9. **Save** — HTML + `docs/toolkit/sources.md` + `docs/toolkit/research-log.md`.

### 7 Tabs

| Tab | Content | Data Source | Interactive |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Dashboard | Exec summary, KPI cards, positioning | PRD + synthesized | Copy-to-clipboard |
| Market Analysis | TAM/SAM/SOM, segments, trends | WebSearch | — |
| Competitive | 3-8 competitors table, positioning matrix | WebSearch + WebFetch | Sortable table |
| Pricing & Economics | Tiers, costs, margins, unit economics | User + WebSearch | Sensitivity sliders, calculator |
| Go-to-Market | Channels, messaging, timeline | WebSearch + PRD | Launch checklist |
| Technical | Architecture, security, integrations | arch.md | Collapsible deep dives |
| Sales Tools | Calculator, talking points, objection handlers | All synthesized | Deal calculator |

### Confidence Tags

- `[Verified]` — Multiple reputable sources agree
- `[Estimated]` — Single source or industry benchmark
- `[Calculated]` — Derived from user data + benchmarks
- `[User-Provided]` — Direct from user input

### Source Citation Pattern

Every section must have:
```html
<details class="hub-sources">
  <summary>Sources & References</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="URL" target="_blank">Title</a> — Retrieved YYYY-MM-DD [Confidence]</li>
  </ul>
</details>
```

## Mode: `/toolkit features [tier]`

Scaffold production infrastructure into the user's app.

### Step 1: Detect Stack

Read `docs/arch.md` for framework, database, auth, hosting.

### Step 2: Ask Tier

If no tier specified, present options:

| Tier | Features | When |
|------|----------|------|
| **T1: MVP** | KPI dashboard, settings system, audit log, health endpoint | Day 1 — every app needs this |
| **T2: Growth** | Analytics, cost monitoring, A/B testing, notifications | After first users |
| **T3: Enterprise** | Multi-tenant admin, RBAC, developer API, compliance | When selling to orgs |

### Step 3: Generate

**For known stacks (Next.js + Supabase):**
- Routes (`src/app/admin/`, `src/app/settings/`)
- Components (KPI cards, settings panels, data tables)
- API endpoints (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/settings/*`)
- Database migrations (tables, RLS policies, indexes)
- Middleware (role-based access guards)

**For other stacks:**
- Detailed spec document at `docs/features/product-infrastructure.md`
- Database schema (SQL-agnostic)
- Route structure recommendation
- Component descriptions

### Step 4: Update Docs

- Add new routes/tables to `docs/arch.md`
- Create `docs/features/product-infrastructure.md` if not exists
- Bump arch.md version

### T1: MVP Features

| Component | Routes | DB Tables |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| KPI Dashboard | `/admin` | — (reads existing tables) |
| Settings System | `/settings/*` | `user_settings`, `user_settings_history` |
| Audit Log | `/admin/audit` | `audit_log` |
| Health Endpoint | `/api/health` | — |
| Version Display | Footer + settings | `lib/version.ts` |

### T2: Growth Features

| Component | Routes | DB Tables |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Analytics | `/admin/analytics` | `analytics_events` |
| Cost Monitoring | `/admin/monitoring` | `operation_metrics`, `cache_metrics` |
| A/B Testing | `/admin/experiments` | `experiments`, `variants`, `user_variants`, `segments`, `metrics` |
| Notification Prefs | `/settings/notifications` | `notification_preferences` |
| Error Tracking | `/admin/errors` | `error_log` |

### T3: Enterprise Features

| Component | Routes | DB Tables |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Multi-Tenant Admin | `/admin/tenants` | `tenants` + RLS policies |
| User Management | `/admin/users` | RBAC tables |
| RBAC System | Middleware | `roles`, `permissions`, `user_roles` |
| Developer Portal | `/settings/developer` | `api_keys`, `api_usage` |
| Compliance | `/settings/privacy` | `data_exports`, `consent_log` |

## Important Rules

- **Research gate** — Never generate the Intelligence Hub without presenting findings to user first
- **Cite everything** — Every data point needs a source URL and confidence tag
- **No personal data** — Never include identifying information in the HTML output
- **Standalone** — HTML must work without a server (open file:// in browser)
- **Regenerable** — Running `/toolkit research` again overwrites with fresh data (with confirmation)
